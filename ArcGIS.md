This short write-up looks at a [GeoNet Blog Post].  In the comments section, a reader posts 
the following bit of code (line numbers have been added for ease of discussion):

1  if (
2       selected(${previous_inspection},"Needs_Repair"),
3       concat("Asset ID: ", "<font color='red'>", ${assetid},"</font"),
4       concat("Asset ID: ", "<font color='blue'>", ${assetid},"</font")
5     )
~~~


There's a lot going on in this code.  Most importantly - the user is freely mixing two distinct languages:  
  - [HTML] and
  - [XLSForm] 
  
Specifically, the dialect of XLSForm that is being used is [survey123 XLSForm].  We can see the 
code uses XLSForm to provide all the functionality, and HTML is used to simply stylize the text.  

We can use the [survey123 XLSForm] reference page to look up all the functions being called.

The if() statement that starts on line 1 spans the entire example.  The format for if() in XLSForm is: 

~~~
if(condition, a, b)  // If condition is true, returns a; otherwise, returns b.
~~~

analyzing the use of if() our original example: 
  - the entirety of line 2 is the condition. 
  - the entirety of line 3 will be returned if the conditional is true.
  - the entirety of line 4 will be returned if the condidtional is false. 

#### Onto line 2:

Here we use the function selected().  According to the reference, selected() works on multiple-choice style 
answers in the form.  Here, we can infer the form has a field named "previous_inspection" and that one of the 
valid choices for that field is "needs_repair".  So, if the user has selected the "needs_repair" option in 
the "previous_inspection" field of the form, this condition will evaluate to true (and we will evaluate only line 3).  Otherwise the condition 
will evaluate to false (and we will evaluate only line 4).  

#### Onto line 3: 

This line will ultimately print the text (with the number 770 being red): 
  - Asset ID: <span style="color:red;">770</span>
  
  concat() simply concatenates as many parameter as you give it together into one sting.  Each parameter is separated by a comma.   
  The first parameter "Asset ID:" will literally print to the screen as text. 
  The second parameter is an HTML font tag that is used to change the text color to red.  
  it is paired witht he close-font tag in the fourth parameter.  Anything between the start and end font will be red. 
  That leaves us with the third parameter: ${assetid}.  Here we can infer that there is some field in the report named assetid.
  And that in this example, one survey has an assetid of 770 and another survey has an assetid of 6678.

#### Onto line 4: 

This line will ultimately print the text (with the number 6678 being blue): 
  - Asset ID: <span style="color:red;">6678</span>
  
  Analysis is much the same as above.
